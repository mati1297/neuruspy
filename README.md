# NeurusPy

NeurusPy is a set of implementations of neural networks, machine learning and optimization algorithms, developed by me while studying subjects on this topics.

It is also an excuse for trying Python continous integration with CircleCI and automatic documentation with Sphinx and GitHub Pages.
